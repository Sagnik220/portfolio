            'This project involves creating a scalable and cost-effective end-to-end data warehousing and reporting solution using Python, OCI Functions, and OCI Data Integration. The solution includes two Python-based microservices: one for extracting semi-structured data from external APIs, converting it to structured CSV, and storing it in Oracle Object Storage; and another for transforming and loading the data into an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW). By leveraging OCI Functions for on-demand invocation and OCI Data Integration for pipeline orchestration, the project ensures a highly efficient and near-zero downtime data pipeline.',
